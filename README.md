# React-Jobly

React-Jobly is a Springboard assignment using React and Create-React-App. The main function of this app is being a mock job searching website, using an api from the backend. The frontend is designed by myself, albeit besides a few small functions to get me going. The backend is provided by Springboard (Although in another one of my repo's there is a version of the backend I did myself here https://github.com/Danielewin8/Springboard/tree/main/Jobly).
