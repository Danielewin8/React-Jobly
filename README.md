# React-Jobly
# https://jobly-frontend-vouq.onrender.com/

React-Jobly is a Springboard assignment using React and Create-React-App. The main function of this app is being a mock job searching website, using an api from the backend. The frontend is designed by myself, albeit besides a few small functions to get me going. The backend is provided by Springboard (Although in another one of my repo's there is a version of the backend I did myself here https://github.com/Danielewin8/Springboard/tree/main/Jobly). 

The site uses the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
